### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used
- [HowlerJS](https://howlerjs.com/)

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/)
    - Bootstrap was used for the responsive 'grid'. Code snippets from the Bootstrap documentation were used in various places and modified to suit the purpose and design of the site.
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
    - jQuery came as part of Bootstrap and was used for Javascript plugins such as the responsive nav bar and modals.
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
    - Google Fonts was used to import the 'Montserrat', 'Lato' and 'Quicksand' fonts, which were used throughout the site.
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
    - Used to source images for the transport section of the remixer.
- [Hover.css](https://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/)
    - 
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
    - Git was used for version control using the terminal in Gitpod to 'add' and 'commit' to Git and to push changes to the GitHub repository using 'git push'.

- [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/)
    - Gitpod.io was used as the primary development environment when coding for the site. It's terminal was used to preview the site via temporary server, and for version control using Git commands.
- [Github](https://github.com/)
    - GitHub was used to store the code pushed from Gitpod and as deployment for the [published site.](https://timmorrisdev.github.io/south-coast-sup/)
- [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/)
    - Balsamiq was used to create the wireframes for the site while in the 'skeleton' stage of my UX process.
- [Autoprefixer](http://autoprefixer.github.io/)
    - Autoprefixer was used in the final stage of development to parse CSS code and add vendor prefixes.

## Deployment
### GitHub Pages
The project was deployed to GitHub pages using the following method. 
1. Log in to [GitHub.com](https://github.com/) and locate the south-coast-sup repository in my account.
2. Select the repo 'settings' menu and navigate to the 'pages' tab on the left hand side.
3. In the 'source' section, select the master branch as the source for the site deployment. 
4. Hit 'save' and wait a few mins for GitHub to process. The 'pages' settings tab will now show a message to confirm the repository is being published to the address https://timmorrisdev.github.io/south-coast-sup/.

### Forking the repository in GitHub
Forking the repository creates a copy of the original repository in your own account to allow changes to be made without affecting the original repository.
1. Log in to GitHub and navigate to the GitHub repository page.
2. In the top-right of the page, below the user avatar, locate the "fork" button.
3. Click the "fork" button and you should now have a copy of the repository in your own account. 

### Making a Local Clone
Details of how to make a local copy of the GutHub repository can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository). To clone using HTTPS follow these steps.
1. Navigate to the GitHub repository.
2. Click the "Code" drop-down menu above the list of files.
3. Copy the HTTPS address to the clipboard using the button provided.
4. Open Terminal.
